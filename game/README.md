# Game

This section of the code is responsible for implementing the m,n,k game (i.e.
Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, etc...)

Implementing the game largely consists of:

    - Keeping track of the board state
    - Keeping track of which player is on-move
    - Ensuring the rules of the game are respected
    - Detecting if the game has ended in a win or a draw
