Let's imagine a world where Tic-Tac-Toe isn't a trivially solved
game.

Great players like TGM Alice Kasparov (elo 2950) compete against
hungry upstarts like TIM Bob Carlsen (elo 2675) for the prestigous
Tic-Tac-Toe World Championship.

This projects builds out a Tic-Tac-Toe engine to explore this
world.

Of course great games must be shared, so a standard file format
for describing a game would be useful. In this world, we have AT3
do do just that. Inspired by PGN, AT3, or algebraic Tic-Tac-Toe,
lets players capture their masterpieces so they live on for
all-time.
